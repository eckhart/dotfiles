dotfiles
========

Some of my dotfiles with configuration for amongst other things:

+ zsh
+ vim
+ urxvt
+ [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
+ [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
+ [bar ain't recursive](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar)

More will be added later. 

I use [dots by EvanPurkhiser](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/dots) to manage my dotfiles. If you're not, you'll have to remove a few lines from some of the files if you intend to use them. 

I steal shamelessly from amongst others:

+ [sheerun](https://github.com/sheerun/dotfiles)
+ [baskerville](https://github.com/baskerville)
+ [windelicato](https://github.com/windelicato/dotfiles)
+ [u-ra](https://github.com/u-ra/dotfiles)
